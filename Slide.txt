Date of Presentation
Slide 2: Introduction

Briefly introduce the importance of web accessibility.
Mention the significance of making web applications compliant with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications).
Slide 3: What is Web Accessibility?

Define web accessibility.
Emphasize the goal: ensuring that websites and web applications are usable by people of all abilities and disabilities.
Slide 4: Why Web Accessibility Matters

Highlight the impact on user experience for people with disabilities.
Mention legal and regulatory requirements.
Address the broader audience reach and improved usability for all users.
Slide 5: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

Define WCAG.
Briefly explain the principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR).
Mention the different conformance levels (A, AA, AAA).

WCAG: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are a set of international standards providing guidelines to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities.

Principles (POUR):

Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presented in ways that users can perceive.
Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
Understandable: Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable.
Robust: Content must be robust enough that it can be reliably interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

Slide 6: Accessibility Features in JSP Code

Outline the current state of the JSP code.
Identify common accessibility challenges in JSP-based web applications.
Slide 7: Introduction to ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

Define ARIA.
Explain how ARIA complements WCAG.
Highlight the role of ARIA in enhancing the accessibility of dynamic content.
Slide 8: Methodology Overview

Outline the step-by-step methodology for converting JSP code to be web accessible.
Mention the use of generative technologies like ChatGPT in the process.
Slide 9: Step 1 - Code Analysis
