Web Accessibility

1.	Adjusting the size of accessible elements, so that users with low visibility can easily access the page.
Using – bootstrap -> js-btn-plus


2.	Added Aria-label, so that it is easier for the user using assistive technologies such as Reader, it describes the role of a particular element.

Using – aria-label= ”Decrease Quantity”

3.	Ensuring that all the elements are reachable and operable using keyboard as well.
Using tabindex=0,-1,1 (focusable). For Example – Make Submit focusable only after, terms and conditions block is clicked.

4.	Once the element is activated, make elements inside it accessible, by adding a js event to change tabindex.
Example- 
 <script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
        // Add event listeners to activate elements on focus
        var activateElements = document.querySelectorAll('[tabindex="-1"]');
        activateElements.forEach(function (element) {
            element.addEventListener('focus', function () {
                element.setAttribute('tabindex', '0');
            });
        });
    });
</script>
5.	To easily help understand, which element is focused, focus styling is applied.
Using - focus-outline, and enhanced styling on focus elements

6.	Skip to important content link at the beginning of the page.
Using - <a href="#main-content" class="sr-only sr-only-focusable">Skip to main content</a>, then adding id=”main-content”

7.	Added labels, wherever missing.
8.	Added Descriptive texts for buttons.
9.	Provided alt text to images.
10.	Added a button to enable high contrast, in the web page 
11.	Only for dynamic validation ->
<!-- Form Validation Message -->
            <div role="alert" id="form-validation-error" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true">
                <!-- Your form validation error message goes here -->
            </div>
If validations fails, then an alert is given, which is read simultaneously by reader

12.	Explicitly associate labels with form attributes for=””
13.	Ensure the link text is descriptive and underlined
