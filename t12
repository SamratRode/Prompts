Tool 1
Analyze the given code for web accessibility and generate a report that checks for
table-based layout using semantic HTML and CSS, incorporating tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, and <aside>.
Accessibility with proper ARIA roles and attributes for key elements, provide descriptive alternative text for images, and handle tab indexing for keyboard navigation.
Keyboard accessibility, visible focus indicators, and testing with a keyboard for dynamic elements.
Visual and keyboard navigation by adjusting element sizes for low visibility users, applying focus styles, including a "Skip to main content" link.
Form accessibility by ensuring clear labels using the “for” attribute, adding descriptive texts to buttons with high contrast mode, and presenting validation messages clearly..
Address JavaScript interaction and nested elements by activating elements dynamically.
Ensure descriptive link text by making it clear and underlined.

Tool2 
To better structure, associate and navigate the content for all users including screen reader users, it is
recommended to add HTML5 semantic tags, ARIA roles and labels, use appropriate heading tags to 
define sections and questions, include skip links, meet WCAG color contrast standards, structure logically 
without tables for layout, add focus styles for keyboard navigation, use semantic tags for lists, include 
ARIA attributes as needed, define the language, include link titles, and ensure all content remains 
readable and operable without stylesheets by adding alt text for images, labeling form fields, linking 
questions to headings with aria-labelledby, and role attributes for non-semantic elements.
